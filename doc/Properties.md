## Color

The background color of the widget.

For widgets with the [Opaque?](#opaque) property, `xw:opaque?` need to be `true` for the background color to be apparent.

`xw:color` | `xw:set-color` | [Color](Colors) | [Tab](Kinds.md#tab), [Button](Kinds.md#button), [Checkbox](Kinds.md#checkbox), [Chooser](Kinds.md#chooser), [Multi-Chooser](Kinds.md#multi-chooser), [Note](Kinds.md#note), [Numeric Input](Kinds.md#numeric-input), [Slider](Kinds.md#slider), [Text-Input](Kinds.md#text-input).

---
## Commands

The commands to be run when a [button](Kinds.md#button) is clicked.

Those commands are provided as a string that is not pre-compiled: if there are errors in the command, you will only find out at runtime. (This is similar to using [`run`](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#run) with a string).

---
## Enabled?

A widget that is enabled allows user to change the value(s) entered in the widget. A widget that is disabled... doesn't. A disabled widget still appears on the screen, but it is grayed out and cannot be changed until it is enabled again.

![](img/enabled-disabled.png)

For a [Note](Kinds.md#note), with which no user interaction is possible anyway, disabling it only makes it appear grayed out.

Note that calling `xw:set-enabled? false` on a [Tab](Kinds.md#tab) will make all the widgets on that tab appear disabled _without_ affecting their [Enabled?](#enabled) property. This way, if you later re-enable the tab, you will get the same mixture of enabled/disabled widgets that you had before disabling the tab. If you _do_ want to individually disable all the widgets on a tab, you can do:

    xw:ask xw:widgets xw:with [ xw:tab = "my-tab" ] [
      xw:set-enabled? false
    ]

## Height
